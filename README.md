This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


Requirement - Please provide instructions on how to integrate and use your component in a sample React application

In the react application that you will integrate the bargraph into, integrate the components folder and display the bargraph with two props - one array with all values for the bar chart (in format of an object with a value component and a legend component) as well as what color theme you want. 

In this application, declare possible prop values for theme (or make it user inputted) and pass them into the bargraph. Declare the state to manage the current theme, and also declare values for the array ( with legend and value values) and pass them into the bargraph as well.
